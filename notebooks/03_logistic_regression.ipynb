    "# Logistic Regression Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on reproducing the results of heart failure prediction with **Logistic Regression**. We will use the same model evaluation metrics as in the original paper and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage of Logistic Regression\n",
    "In the paper, logistic regression is seemingly used for different purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see in [Table 4](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5/tables/4) that a linear model was used to compare it against other Machine Learning methods. Some might assume that for this binary classification problem, logistic regression was used. From the [code](https://github.com/davidechicco/cardiovascular_heart_disease/blob/master/bin/lin_reg_classification.r) the authors made available, it becomes apparent that in [Table 4](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5/tables/4) they used linear regression for a binary classification problem and set a threshold of 0.5 to classify the regression outcome. While this is a possible way the logistic regression would have been better suited for this task since it is probabilistic and not continuous.</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in [Table 10](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5/tables/10) the full model with an added temporal component (*follow-up time*) was used to determine the feature ranking. It concluded that *ejection fraction* and *serum creatinine* are the most important.</br>\n",
    "To draw this conclusion the authors have not worked with a train/test set but shuffled the dataset 100 times and used an average ranking. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on that, the authors decided to compare a full model to a restricted model using only *ejection fraction*, *serum creatinine*, and *follow-up time* as shown in [Table 11](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5/tables/11) and evaluate their performance using the already introduced performance measures. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reproduction, we will focus on the comparison of the restricted and unrestricted models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is as follows:\n",
    "1. Transform time as a factor as proposed by the authors\n",
    "2. Split the data into train and test sets\n",
    "3. Fit the models on the train set \n",
    "4. Calculate evaluation metrics\n",
    "5. Repeat the procedure 100 times and aggregate the results"
